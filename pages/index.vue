      My growing collection of tools for CMDRs. These are mostly utilisations of
      the awesome already existing tools out there, mainly created for my own
      usage but some CMDR out there might find them useful.

    <a href="bgs/route-advisor"><strong>BGS Route Advisor</strong></a>
    <p>
      A tool to create an efficient route through the systems of your faction.
      It generates a table with systems where the faction is present in which
      you can select all the systems you would like to visit/update. Giving it a
      few extra infos it creates a link to
      <a href="https://spansh.co.uk/tourist/">spansh.co.uk</a> to optimise the
      route. The faction data is beeing fetched from the
      <a href="https://elitebgs.app/">EliteBGS</a> API.
